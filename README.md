This is the first program I created for my portfolio. Itâ€™s a simple yet functional translator that converts text to Morse code.

Writing the code for this program was an enjoyable experience.
I knew there would be few glitches and that the functions would be straightforward, so I was able to move through it smoothly!
However, I still wanted to maintain some level of discipline by using basic class functionality and clear functions to ensure the code is easy to read.
